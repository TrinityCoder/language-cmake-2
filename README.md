# language-cmake-2 package

Syntax highlighting for CMake in atom. Converted from the
[Textmate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/cmake.tmbundle)

---

This is continuation of the [`lucas-clemente/language-cmake`][1] Atom package,
which has been discontinued in 2020, with [last commit from 30 May 2019][2]
and the last supported CMake version 3.14.

`language-cmake-2` is a continuation of this project, which starts at the same
place where the original left.

## How to install
First, you should remove the old, unupdated `language-cmake` package by
running

```sh
apm uninstall language-cmake
```

Then, install the `language-cmake-2` package:

```sh
apm install language-cmake-2
```
